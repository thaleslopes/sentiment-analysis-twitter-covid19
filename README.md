# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data related to COVID-19


## NLP algorithms used: BERT, DistilBERT and NBSVM

The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact in Brazil and in the world, generating
negative repercussions not only in healthcare, but also affecting society at social, political and
economic levels. In view of the evolution of the popularity of social networks in the 21st
century, we observe the large volume of data generated and the potential that this information
has to be used as health surveillance tools. In this scenario, this work presents a study of the
feelings that the Brazilian population has about the current situation of COVID-19 in Brazil
through the study of the social network Twitter. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a data
mining process using the social network, which is directly related to COVID-19. Different data
pre-processing methodologies are applied to make a comparison between different sentiment
classifiers in order to analyze the viability of the social network Twitter as a tool for health
surveillance and prediction of feelings related to COVID-19. Multi-class classifiers were built
that obtained levels of accuracy of 55%. The process executed identifies a significant degree of
discontent among Brazilians in relation to COVID-19. It is uncertain whether the sample of
tweets collected in this study represents the distribution of feelings within the total population
of tweets. This study imposes the verification of the potential that the algorithms BERT,
DistilBERT and NBSVM have to classify opinions and feelings.
